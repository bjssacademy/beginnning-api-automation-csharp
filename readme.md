# Beginning API Automation

If you are here, we're going to assume that you need to automate some API testing.

We're also going to assume that you know about HTTP Methods, what and API is, and have probably messed around with one using Postman, ThunderClient, Bruno or something similar and are okay with JSON.

If you haven't, then this is going to all be very, very strange. We'd recommend having a look at [How the internet works](https://github.com/bjssacademy/internet-and-technologies), [Http Fundamentals](https://github.com/bjssacademy/fundamentals-http), [JSON](https://github.com/bjssacademy/fundamentals-json), as well as some basic C#.

Okay, so let's dive in.

We're going to learn how to *build* an API first, so we can see how they work behind the scenes. Then we'll set about automating it.

Along the way we'll look at concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), Factories, Services, and HttpClients.
